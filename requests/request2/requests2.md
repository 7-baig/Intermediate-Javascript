**fetch() GET Requests I**
The first type of requests weâ€™re going to tackle are GET requests using fetch().
*The fetch() function:*
1    Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
2    Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
3    Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.
